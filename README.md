# Database Lab
## [Lab-01:](https://github.com/arman324/Database-Lab/blob/master/Lab-01/Lab-01.sql)
First of all, I created a database and then created and filled tables. After that I answered 3 questions:
1. For a student who has a student number 123, show the details of the department where he or she is studying. You can see my answer on line number 156.
2. Write a 'select' that adds a score to each student's grade in each lesson. You can see my answer on line number 162.
3. Write a query to display students who have not taken the DB course. You can see my answer on line number 166.
